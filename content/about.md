Hello, I'm Rodrigo Tavares.

This blog is a reflection of my diverse interests. While my professional life revolves around the world of Linux Containers, Kubernetes, and OpenShift, I am deeply interested in a variety of other topics. You'll find posts here about politics, economy, society, and philosophy.

I am an avid reader and enjoy sharing my thoughts on the books I read. You can expect to find simple book reviews on this blog. I also plan to supplement my articles with YouTube videos, providing a different medium to share my insights.

While I strive to provide accurate and insightful content, it's important to note that the opinions expressed on this blog are my own.

Thank you for visiting my blog. I hope you find the content informative and engaging.
